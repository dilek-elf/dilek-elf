## Hello there, I’m Dilek 👋  

🐶 Dog mom | 📚 Literature graduate | 💻 Web development beginner

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I studied literature, which means I love stories, details, and making sense of things. Recently, I started learning web development, where I now do the same thing but with code (and more bugs).

## 📚 Currently studying

- Studying IT & Web Development.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the fundamentals of modern web development.
- Small projects and exercises to better understand structure, layout, and interactivity.
- Clean design, responsive layouts, and user-friendly interfaces.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

- 🌿-I don’t rush learning. I prefer steady progress, good structure, and thoughtful design.  
- Every project is a chance to learn something new.
- 🧠 **Mindset**: I prefer learning things properly instead of quickly. I value clarity, structure, and simplicity.
- ❓ **Always** ask questions.
- ✨ **Hobbies & Interests**
  I enjoy cozy movie nights, going to concerts, baking from scratch, traveling + testing local kitchen, and getting lost in a good book.

## 📌 Goals

- Grow into a confident junior web developer.
- Build things that make sense and feel good to use.
- Stay patient and trust the learning process.
- Balance learning, creativity, and everyday life.
-

## ✨ Fun facts

- I believe small progress still counts.
- I love books as much as I love learning new things.
- My dog keeps me company while I study.
